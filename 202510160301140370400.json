NVIDIA, Amazon, Google, and Meta were selected for their significant revenue growth, high profitability, healthy ROE/ROA, and low debt. A portion of the funds is allocated to cryptocurrencies for potentially higher returns, aligning with an aggressive risk appetite, while a small cash equivalent allocation provides minimal liquidity. This strategy aims for substantial capital gains but also carries higher risk.",
