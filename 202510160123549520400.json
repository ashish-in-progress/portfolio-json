If one asset class significantly outperforms, its weight in the portfolio will increase, potentially exposing you to more risk. Rebalancing involves selling some of the outperforming assets and buying more of the underperforming ones to restore target percentages, thus managing risk and locking in gains.",

Understand that market values can fluctuate dramatically. Only invest capital you are comfortable potentially losing, and ensure your financial goals align with the inherent volatility of this aggressive strategy."
