Within equities, a mix of fundamentally strong large-cap stocks with good growth metrics and high-performing small and mid-cap mutual funds are chosen to provide diversification and tap into aggressive growth segments.

While the portfolio aims for aggressive growth, the inclusion of diversifiers like gold and debt FDs offers some buffer, but significant equity exposure means higher volatility.
