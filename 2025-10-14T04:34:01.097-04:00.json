It allocates a significant portion to leading technology stocks known for their innovation, market dominance, and strong financial performance. While mutual funds were allocated a percentage, specific funds could not be selected due to an unavailable data source, but general diversified growth funds would be considered. Diversifiers include a portion for cryptocurrency for extremely high-risk, high-reward potential, and smaller allocations to gold and bond mutual funds to provide some minimal stability within an otherwise growth-focused strategy. This aggressive approach aligns with a high-risk profile aiming for substantial capital appreciation over a long investment horizon.",

The simulations demonstrate potential losses of $5,000 to $15,000 in various crash scenarios. While diversification across different asset classes helps mitigate some risk, the heavy concentration in high-growth stocks and cryptocurrency means significant volatility should be expected. Regular rebalancing and a long-term perspective are crucial for navigating these risks.",

    "rebalancing_strategy": "Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. If some assets grow significantly, they might exceed their target percentage, increasing your risk exposure. Selling high and buying low during rebalancing can help manage risk and lock in gains.",
