    "diversification_importance": "While this portfolio is concentrated, for broader risk management, diversification across different asset classes (e.g., bonds, real estate, commodities) and geographies can reduce overall portfolio volatility. Even within equities, diversifying across sectors and company sizes can be beneficial.",
    "long_term_perspective": "High-growth stock portfolios often experience significant short-term fluctuations. A long-term investment horizon (typically 5+ years) allows time for market cycles to play out and for companies to grow, potentially mitigating the impact of short-term volatility.",
    "rebalancing_strategy": "Given the dynamic nature of high-growth stocks, regular portfolio reviews are crucial. Rebalancing, though not directly applicable to a 100% stock portfolio in the traditional sense, involves assessing if the individual stock weightings still align with your conviction. For diversified portfolios, it means adjusting asset allocations back to original targets.",
    "understanding_risk": "Investing in individual high-growth stocks carries inherent risks, including market risk, specific company risk, and liquidity risk. It's important to only invest capital that you are comfortable losing and to continuously educate yourself on market dynamics and company fundamentals."
