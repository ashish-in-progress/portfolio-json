While the long investment horizon allows for recovery, significant paper losses can be expected during market crashes.

    "diversification_importance": "Diversification across various asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, and even alternative assets like gold and crypto) is crucial to manage risk. It helps cushion the impact of poor performance in any single asset class or sector, contributing to a more stable long-term growth trajectory.",
    "long_term_perspective": "For an aggressive portfolio with a 20-year horizon, maintaining a long-term perspective is vital. Market fluctuations are normal, and reacting impulsively to short-term downturns can jeopardize long-term growth. Patience and commitment to the initial strategy are key.",
    "rebalancing_strategy": "Periodically rebalancing your portfolio (e.g., annually) is essential to maintain your desired asset allocation. If one asset class significantly outperforms, its proportion in the portfolio will increase. Rebalancing involves selling some of the outperforming assets and buying more of the underperforming ones to bring the portfolio back to its target allocation, helping to manage risk and lock in gains.",
    "understanding_risk": "Understanding that aggressive portfolios come with higher potential returns but also higher risks is paramount. While this portfolio is designed for growth, be prepared for significant volatility. Educate yourself on market trends, economic indicators, and the specifics of your investments to make informed decisions and stay resilient during challenging periods."
