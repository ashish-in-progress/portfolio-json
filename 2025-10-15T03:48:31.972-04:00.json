A mild crash could see a 10% reduction, while a severe crash could lead to a 30% loss of the total portfolio value. Diversification within growth assets (different tech stocks, two major cryptos) helps mitigate idiosyncratic risks but does not protect against systemic market risks inherent in high-volatility assets. Regular monitoring and a long-term investment horizon are crucial for navigating these risks.",

  "education_tips": {
    "diversification_importance": "While this portfolio is concentrated in high-growth assets, broader diversification across different asset classes (e.g., bonds, real estate) typically helps reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk. For a high-risk profile, diversification within high-growth sectors is key.",
    "long_term_perspective": "High-risk, high-growth investments like those in this portfolio often experience significant short-term fluctuations. Maintaining a long-term investment horizon (3+ years as stated) allows time for these assets to recover from downturns and realize their growth potential.",
    "rebalancing_strategy": "Even with a high-risk portfolio, it's wise to periodically rebalance. If one asset class (e.g., crypto) significantly outperforms, it might grow to an excessively large proportion of your portfolio. Rebalancing involves selling some of the outperforming assets and buying more of the underperforming ones to maintain your desired allocation percentages and risk level.",
    "understanding_risk": "Understanding that past performance is not indicative of future results is critical. High-growth assets carry inherent risks, and losses are possible. Only invest capital that you are comfortable losing and ensure your overall financial plan accounts for potential market volatility."
