    "summary": "This portfolio, composed entirely of bond mutual funds, is generally considered to have lower volatility compared to equity-heavy portfolios. While a market crash can still impact bond values, the impact is often less severe than on stocks. Government and investment-grade corporate bonds tend to be more resilient during economic downturns. It's crucial to understand that even low-risk investments are not immune to market fluctuations, and capital preservation is the primary goal.",

  "education_tips": {
    "diversification_importance": "While this portfolio is focused on bond mutual funds, diversification within the bond sector (e.g., government vs. corporate, different maturities) helps mitigate risks specific to certain types of bonds or issuers. A broader portfolio, if risk tolerance allows, would include different asset classes like stocks, though for a low-risk profile, bonds are key.",
    "long_term_perspective": "Even with low-risk investments, maintaining a long-term perspective is crucial. Market fluctuations can occur, but over time, consistent returns from bond funds can compound effectively. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements.",
    "rebalancing_strategy": "For a bond-heavy portfolio, rebalancing might involve adjusting allocations to different bond types or durations to maintain your desired risk exposure and return profile. Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it still aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance, especially as interest rate environments change.",
    "understanding_risk": "All investments carry some level of risk. While bond mutual funds are generally less volatile than stocks, they are still subject to interest rate risk, inflation risk, and credit risk. Understanding these risks helps you make informed decisions and manage your expectations for portfolio performance."
