This involves selling assets that have performed well and buying those that have underperformed to bring the portfolio back to its target percentages, ensuring risk levels remain consistent with your objectives.",
    "understanding_risk": "It is crucial to fully understand the risks associated with high-growth, high-volatility assets like individual stocks and cryptocurrencies. While they offer higher return potential, they also carry a greater risk of capital loss. Only invest what you are comfortable losing and ensure your risk tolerance aligns with your chosen strategy."
