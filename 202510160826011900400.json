The stock selection includes well-established companies like Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, and Procter & Gamble, providing a mix of growth and stability. The mutual fund component utilizes Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) for broad market exposure, while Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX) provides stability and income for the bond portion. \n\n**Future Changes & Strategy:**\n*   **Annual Investment Increase:** Each year, 10% of the previous year's total portfolio profit will be added to the initial investment, boosting overall capital. \n*   **Bi-Annual Rebalancing:** The portfolio will be rebalanced every two years to maintain the target 70:20:10 asset allocation (stocks:mutual funds:bonds), ensuring it stays aligned with the moderate risk profile and long-term objectives. This systematic approach helps manage risk and capture market opportunities over the 7-year investment period.",
